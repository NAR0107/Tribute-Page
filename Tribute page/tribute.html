He grew up in an atmosphere of privilege at wealthy homes, including a palatial estate called the Anand Bhavan. His father had him educated at 
home by private governesses and tutors. Influenced by the Irish theosophist Ferdinand T. Brooks' teaching, Nehru became interested in 
science and theosophy.His family friend, Annie Besant subsequently gain him into the Theosophical Society at the  of age 13. However, his 
interest in theosophy did not prove to be enduring, and he left the society shortly after Brooks departed as his tutor. He wrote: "for nearly three years [Brooks] was 
with me and in many ways, he influenced me greatly".Theosophical interests had induced him to the study of the Buddhist and Hindu scriptures.

Bertrand Russell, Lowes Dickinson and Meredith Townsend moulded much of his political and economic thinking.After completing his degree in 1910,

After returning to India in August 1912, Nehru enrolled as an advocate of the Allahabad High Court and tried to settle down as a barrister. But 
unlike his father, he had very little interest in his profession and relished neither the practice of law nor the company of 
lawyers: "Decidedly the atmosphere was not intellectually stimulating and a sense of the utter insipidity of
 life grew upon me." His father involvement only on nationalist politics was to gradually replace his legal practice.

Nehru had developed an interest in Indian politics during his time in Britain as a student and a barrister.
Within months of his return to India in 1912, Nehru attended an annual session of the Indian National Congress in Patna. Congress in 
1912 was the party of moderates and elites, and he was disconcerted by what he saw as "very much an English-knowing upper-class affair".
Nehru doubted the effectiveness of Congress but agreed to work for the party in support of the Indian civil rights movement led by Mahatma Gandhi in 
South Africa, collecting funds for the movement in 1913. Later, he campaigned against indentured labour and other such discrimination faced by 
Indians in the British colonies.
